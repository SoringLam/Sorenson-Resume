        <div class="subheading mb-5">Physician's AssistantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hi! My name is Sorenson Lam. I am a third year student at University of California, Riverside. My major is Biology. I am aiming to be a Physician's Assistant. I am currently volunteering at my nearby Kaiser hospital in Northern California. I work with patients on the daily, 4 hours a day. This volunteer experience allowed me to confirm with myself that I want to be a Physician's Assistant. Standing in the front lies makes me feel like I have done something. I guess you could say my joy is from all the shows I watch. I really love to watch Marvel movies as well as some anime. One of my favorite anime is My Hero Academia. The hero vibes really get to me. I think it is really cool how they portrait heros and the cool lines they use. Watching these heroes aspired me to be a hero to as a kid. I know I can't save people like how they would, but not all heroes wear capes. I plan on wearing scrubs and a lab coat. <br><br>

        Enter In highschool, I played volleyball and basketball during lunch with friends. It was really fun. I also made the team. Although it was very tiring, it was doable and fun because of my friends. They are what made me continue to play sports. Working with my teammates and being team player, I think I will be able to work effectively with my coworkers. I like to be depended on. Although doing patient care and playing sports is not the same, the basic understanding of teamwork can transition to almost anything. <br><br>

        Recently, one of my newly acquired quarantine hobbies has been collecting houseplants! Some of my favorite houseplants right now are my Alocasia Dwarf Polly and my variegated String of Hearts. My Alocasia Dwarf Polly is a dark green leaf shaped like an elephant ear with striking white veins. It has beautiful purple coloring on the back with some delicate veins running through it. I just got this one at a local flea market for a good price! My other favorite, my variegated String of Hearts, is a plant I also got for such a steal. This plant was worth upwards of $20 for a single leaf and so much more on sites like etsy and online stores, but I only got it for $15 for a full pot! It looks like a string with delicate green hearts with pink edges attached to it. Some leaves (hearts) have full variegation, meaning they're completely pink! Definitely one of the coolest and low maintenance plants Iâ€™ve ever gotten. It also classifies as a fast growing succulent! My houseplant wish list is ever growing and these plants are definitely something I cherish and look forward to after a long day at Kaiser!
